# Request Header Parser Microservice

This is the second project of the "Back End Development and APIs" certification by Free Code Camp. The goal of this project is to build a JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this example](https://request-header-parser-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/).

## Description

The Request Header Parser Microservice project aims to create an API service that retrieves and provides information about the client's request headers. It fulfills the following requirements:

- A request to `/api/whoami` should return a JSON object with the client's IP address in the `ipaddress` key.
- A request to `/api/whoami` should return a JSON object with the client's preferred language in the `language` key.
- A request to `/api/whoami` should return a JSON object with the client's software in the `software` key.
